# Attributions

- The lib itself is an implementation of a solution discussed in a [fireship video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITogH7lJTyE);
- The site's layout is heavily inspired by [cmd k](https://cmdk.paco.me);
- The version glitch animation was reverse engineered from [simple bookmarks](https://bmrks.com);
- The stacking cards were adapted from a css-tricks [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NXtz59).
